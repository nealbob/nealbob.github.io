I'm an economist currently working at [ABARES](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares). I completed a [Phd](../images/Thesis_main.pdf) at the [ANU](http://www.anu.edu.au) in 2015 and currently hold a Visiting Fellow position in the [ANU Crawford School](https://crawford.anu.edu.au/people/visitors/neal-hughes).

A lot of my [research](../research) has focused on water, climate and agricultural issues. ABARES recent water and climate research can be accessed [here](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/water-and-climate).

I live in Canberra, Australia with my wife Kylie and daughter Elizabeth.
