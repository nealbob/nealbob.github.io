I'm an economist currently working at [ABARES](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares). I have a [Phd](../images/Thesis_main.pdf) in economics from the [ANU](http://www.anu.edu.au).

A lot of my [research](../research) has focused on water, climate and agricultural issues. I also have an interest in applying [machine learning]({% post_url 2016-10-1-MLfordummies %}) techniques to economics.

I live in Canberra, Australia with my wife Kylie, daughter Elizabeth and son River.
