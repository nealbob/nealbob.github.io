I'm an economist currently working at [ABARES](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares). 

A lot of my [research](../research) has focused on water, climate and agricultural issues. I also have an interest in applying [machine learning]({% post_url 2016-10-1-MLfordummies %}) techniques to economics.

I live in Geelong, Australia with my wife Kylie, daughter Elizabeth and son River.
