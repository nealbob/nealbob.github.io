I'm an economist working at [ABARES](http://www.daff.gov.au/abares) and completing a Phd at the [ANU](https://crawford.anu.edu.au/people/phd/neal-hughes).<br> <br> A lot of my [research](../research) has focused on water, particularly water property rights and markets in the context of storage (i.e., large dams). Here is my [CV](../images/cv_7.pdf).  <br> <br> As an economist I'm a bit of a frustrated engineer and computer programmer.  Recently I've been working on adapting machine learning methods to economic problems, see the [code](../code) page if your interested. <br><br>  I live in Canberra, Australia with my wife Kylie and daughter Elizabeth.
