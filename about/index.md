I'm an economist currently working at [ABARES](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares). I have a [Phd](../images/Thesis_main.pdf) in economics from the [ANU](http://www.anu.edu.au) and hold a Visiting Fellow position in the [ANU Crawford School](https://crawford.anu.edu.au/people/visitors/neal-hughes).

A lot of my [research](../research) has focused on water, climate and agricultural issues. ABARES recent water research can be accessed [here](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/water), while recent climate research can be found [here](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/climate).

I also have an interest in applying [machine learning]({% post_url 2016-10-1-MLfordummies %}) techniques to economics.

I live in Canberra, Australia with my wife Kylie, daughter Elizabeth and son River.
