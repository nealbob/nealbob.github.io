I'm an economist currently working at [ABARES](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares). A lot of my [research](../research) has focused on water, climate and agricultural issues. ABARES recent water and climate research can be accessed [here](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/water-and-climate).

I live in Canberra, Australia with my wife Kylie and daughter Elizabeth.
